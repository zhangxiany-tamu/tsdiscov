\usage{
ts_mv_network(X, threshold = 0.5, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Numeric matrix (N x T) where rows are time series}

\item{threshold}{Numeric; correlation threshold for edge creation (default: 0.5).
Only correlations with |r| >= threshold create edges.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (for compatibility)}
}
\value{
Named list with 5 features:
\itemize{
  \item \code{network_density}: Fraction of possible edges that exist
  \item \code{network_clustering}: Average clustering coefficient
  \item \code{network_assortativity}: Degree assortativity (degree correlation)
  \item \code{network_modularity}: Newman modularity (community structure strength)
  \item \code{network_centralization}: Network centralization (hub dominance)
}
}
\description{
Constructs a correlation network where nodes represent time series and edges
represent strong correlations, then computes standard network topology metrics.
These features capture connectivity patterns, community structure, and the
overall network architecture of the multivariate system.
}
\details{
The correlation network is constructed by:
\enumerate{
  \item Computing pairwise correlations between all series
  \item Creating edges for correlations with |r| >= threshold
  \item Computing network metrics on the resulting graph
}

Network metrics interpretation:
\itemize{
  \item **Density**: Ranges from 0 (no edges) to 1 (complete graph). High density
        indicates many strong pairwise relationships.
  \item **Clustering**: Measures local connectivity. High clustering indicates
        tightly connected groups.
  \item **Assortativity**: Measures if high-degree nodes connect to other
        high-degree nodes. Positive = assortative, negative = disassortative.
  \item **Modularity**: Measures community structure strength. Higher values
        indicate distinct modules/communities.
  \item **Centralization**: Measures if network has dominant hub nodes. High
        values indicate star-like topology.
