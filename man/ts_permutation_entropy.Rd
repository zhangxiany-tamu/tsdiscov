\title{Extract Permutation Entropy features}
\usage{
ts_permutation_entropy(x, dims = c(4, 5), delay = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector}

\item{dims}{Integer vector of embedding dimensions (default: c(4, 5))
Note: dim=3 is already provided by ts_entropy() as perm_entropy}

\item{delay}{Time delay for embedding (default: 1)}
}
\value{
Named list with permutation entropy for each dimension
}
\description{
Computes permutation entropy (Bandt-Pompe) which measures complexity
via ordinal patterns. Higher values indicate more randomness.
}
\details{
Permutation entropy quantifies the diversity of ordinal patterns in the time series.
It's robust to noise and useful for detecting deterministic vs stochastic dynamics.
