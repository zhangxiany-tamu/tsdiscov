\title{Extract Welch Power Spectral Density features}
\usage{
ts_welch(x, n_freq = 5, window_size = -1, overlap = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector}

\item{n_freq}{Number of frequency bins (default: 5)}

\item{window_size}{Window size for segments. If -1, automatically determined.}

\item{overlap}{Overlap fraction between windows (default: 0.5)}
}
\value{
Named list with power in each frequency bin
}
\description{
Computes Welch's power spectral density estimate using overlapping windows.
More robust than simple FFT for noisy signals. Returns power in frequency bins.
}
\details{
Uses Hanning window with 50% overlap by default for optimal variance reduction.
