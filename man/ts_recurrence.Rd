\usage{
ts_recurrence(
  x,
  threshold_percent = 0.1,
  min_line_length = 2,
  max_points = 2000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector}

\item{threshold_percent}{Threshold as percentile of distances (default: 0.1)}

\item{min_line_length}{Minimum line length to count (default: 2)}

\item{max_points}{Maximum points to analyze (default: 2000)}
}
\value{
Named list with RQA measures
}
\description{
Analyzes recurrence plots to quantify nonlinear dynamics.
Reveals deterministic structure, laminar states, and complexity.
}
\details{
RQA is powerful for detecting:
- Determinism: presence of predictable dynamics
- Laminarity: presence of laminar (slowly changing) states
- Complexity: via diagonal line entropy
}
