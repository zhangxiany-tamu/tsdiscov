\title{Extract Time Series Features as Data Frame}
\usage{
ts_features_df(x, features = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector or ts object representing the time series}

\item{features}{Character vector of feature sets to extract. Use "all" (default)
for the complete set, or specify subsets like c("stats", "acf", "trend").}
}
\value{
A 1-row data.frame with one column per feature, in stable order
}
\description{
Wrapper around ts_features() that returns results as a 1-row data.frame.
This format is convenient for extracting features from multiple time series
and combining them with rbind().
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Extract features from a single series
x <- rnorm(100)
df <- ts_features_df(x, features = c("stats", "acf"))

# Extract from multiple series and combine
series_list <- list(rnorm(100), rnorm(100), rnorm(100))
results <- do.call(rbind, lapply(series_list, ts_features_df))
}
}
