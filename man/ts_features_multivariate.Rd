\title{Extract features from multivariate time series}
\usage{
ts_features_multivariate(
  X,
  features = "all",
  standardize = TRUE,
  max_lag = 20,
  bins = 10,
  correlation_method = "pearson",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Either a matrix (N x T) where N is number of series and T is timepoints,
or a list of N numeric vectors of equal length T}

\item{features}{Character vector of feature sets to extract. Options:
\itemize{
  \item "all" - All available multivariate features (default)
  \item "pca" - PCA-based features (15 features)
  \item "correlation" - Correlation structure features (15 features)
  \item "covariance" - Covariance matrix features (5 features)
  \item "sync" - Synchronization features (8 features)
  \item "diversity" - Diversity and complexity features (7 features)
  \item "total_correlation" - Information-theoretic complexity (2 features)
  \item "lag_structure" - Temporal relationship patterns (4 features)
  \item "network" - Graph/network topology metrics (5 features)
}
Can specify multiple sets, e.g., c("pca", "correlation")}

\item{standardize}{Logical; if TRUE (default), standardizes each series to
have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 before computing features}

\item{max_lag}{Integer; maximum lag for cross-correlation analysis (default 20).
Used by synchronization features. Will be capped at floor(T/4) where T is series length.}

\item{bins}{Integer; number of bins for histogram-based features (default 10).
Used by synchronization (mutual information) and diversity features.}

\item{correlation_method}{Character; correlation method for correlation features.
One of "pearson" (default), "spearman", or "kendall".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently ignored, reserved for future use)}
}
\value{
Named list of multivariate features. The number of features depends
  on which feature sets are requested.
}
\description{
Extracts features that characterize the joint behavior of multiple time series.
Supports analysis of sensor arrays, multi-channel signals, and other multivariate
engineering data.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Example 1: Matrix input (5 sensors, 200 timepoints)
set.seed(123)
X_matrix <- matrix(rnorm(5 * 200), nrow = 5, ncol = 200)
# Add correlation structure
X_matrix[2,] <- 0.7 * X_matrix[1,] + 0.3 * rnorm(200)
features <- ts_features_multivariate(X_matrix)

# Example 2: List input (3 channels)
X_list <- list(
  channel1 = rnorm(150),
  channel2 = rnorm(150),
  channel3 = rnorm(150)
)
features <- ts_features_multivariate(X_list, standardize = TRUE)

# Example 3: Extract specific feature sets
pca_feats <- ts_features_multivariate(X_matrix, features = "pca")
corr_feats <- ts_features_multivariate(X_matrix, features = c("pca", "correlation"))
}
