\title{Cross-spectral and coherence features for multivariate time series}
\usage{
ts_mv_spectral(X)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Matrix (N x T) where N is number of series, T is timepoints}
}
\value{
Named list of 10 cross-spectral features
}
\description{
Extracts features characterizing frequency-domain relationships between series.
Uses magnitude-squared coherence and cross-spectral density to measure
frequency-specific synchronization.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create signals with coherent low-frequency component
t <- seq(0, 10, length.out = 256)
common <- sin(2*pi*t) + sin(4*pi*t)
X <- matrix(0, nrow = 3, ncol = 256)
