\title{Total Correlation Features}
\usage{
ts_mv_total_correlation(X, bins = 10, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Numeric matrix (N x T) where rows are time series}

\item{bins}{Integer, number of bins for discretization (default: 10)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (for compatibility)}
}
\value{
Named list with 2 features:
\itemize{
  \item \code{total_correlation}: Total correlation TC(X) = sum(H(Xi)) - H(X)
  \item \code{dual_total_correlation}: Dual total correlation (binding information)
}
}
\description{
Computes information-theoretic features that capture multivariate dependencies
beyond pairwise correlations. Total correlation (also called multi-information)
measures how much information is shared among all variables beyond what can be
explained by looking at each variable independently.
}
\details{
Total correlation quantifies the amount of redundancy or dependency among
all variables. A value of 0 indicates complete independence, while higher
values indicate stronger multivariate dependencies.

Dual total correlation (binding information) measures the information that
binds the variables together, computed as the difference between joint entropy
and conditional entropies.
