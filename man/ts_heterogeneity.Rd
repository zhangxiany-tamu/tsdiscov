\title{Extract heterogeneity features (ARCH/GARCH)}
\usage{
ts_heterogeneity(x, fit_garch = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector}

\item{fit_garch}{Logical, whether to fit GARCH model (requires tseries package)}
}
\value{
Named list of heterogeneity features
}
\description{
Computes measures of volatility clustering and heterogeneity.
Pre-whitens using R's ar() function, then computes ARCH effects.
Optionally fits GARCH(1,1) using tseries::garch() and computes GARCH effects.
}
