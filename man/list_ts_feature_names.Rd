\title{List Feature Names for Given Feature Sets}
\usage{
list_ts_feature_names(x, features = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector (time series)}

\item{features}{Character vector of feature set names, or "all"}
}
\value{
Character vector of feature names
}
\description{
Returns the actual feature names that would be extracted by ts_features()
for the given feature sets. Useful for dynamic test expectations and
understanding what features will be computed.
}
\examples{
# Get feature names for specific sets
x <- rnorm(100)
names_stats <- list_ts_feature_names(x, features = "stats")
names_acf <- list_ts_feature_names(x, features = c("stats", "acf"))

# Get all feature names
all_names <- list_ts_feature_names(x, features = "all")
length(all_names)
}
