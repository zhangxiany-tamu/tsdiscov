\title{Extract Friedrich coefficient features}
\usage{
ts_friedrich(x, max_order = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector}

\item{max_order}{Maximum polynomial order (default: 3)}
}
\value{
Named list with polynomial coefficients a0, a1, a2, a3
}
\description{
Computes Friedrich coefficients from Langevin model fitting.
Models drift as polynomial: dx/dt = a0 + a1*x + a2*x^2 + a3*x^3.
}
\details{
These coefficients capture deterministic dynamics in noisy time series.
Used in physics, climate science, and neuroscience for detecting
nonlinear drift terms.
