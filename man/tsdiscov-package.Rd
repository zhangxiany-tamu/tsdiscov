\title{tsdiscov: Time Series Feature Extraction}
\description{
Extracts 352 univariate, 6 bivariate, and 61 multivariate features from time series data. Includes statistical, spectral, entropy, complexity, and nonlinear measures with efficient C++ implementations. Bivariate features analyze pairwise relationships. Multivariate features cover PCA, correlation, synchronization, diversity, information theory, lag structure, and network topology. Supports automated feature selection via hypothesis testing with FDR/FWER correction.
