\title{Extract all time series features (univariate and/or multivariate)}
\usage{
ts_features_all(
  X,
  feature_type = c("auto", "univariate", "multivariate", "both"),
  univariate_summary = c("none", "aggregate", "per_series"),
  multivariate_sets = "all",
  standardize = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Numeric vector (univariate), matrix (N x T), or list of N vectors}

\item{feature_type}{Character string specifying which features to extract:
\itemize{
  \item "auto" - Automatically detect (default): univariate for vectors,
        multivariate for matrices/lists with N >= 2
  \item "univariate" - Extract only univariate features
  \item "multivariate" - Extract only multivariate features (requires N >= 2)
  \item "both" - Extract both univariate and multivariate features
}}

\item{univariate_summary}{Character string for multivariate input:
\itemize{
  \item "none" - No univariate features (default for multivariate)
  \item "aggregate" - Aggregate univariate features across series
        (mean, median, max, min, sd of each feature)
  \item "per_series" - Individual univariate features for each series
        (can produce many features for large N)
}}

\item{multivariate_sets}{Character vector of multivariate feature sets
(default "all"). Options: "all", "pca", "correlation", "covariance",
"sync", "spectral", "diversity", or combinations}

\item{standardize}{Logical; standardize multivariate series (default TRUE)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to feature extraction functions}
}
\value{
Named list of features. Length depends on feature_type and input.
}
\description{
Unified interface for extracting comprehensive time series features.
Automatically detects input type and extracts appropriate features.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Univariate: single time series
x <- rnorm(200)
features <- ts_features_all(x)
length(features)  # 352 univariate features

# Multivariate: multiple time series
X <- matrix(rnorm(5 * 200), nrow = 5, ncol = 200)
features <- ts_features_all(X)
length(features)  # 66 multivariate features

# Both univariate and multivariate
features <- ts_features_all(X, feature_type = "both",
                             univariate_summary = "aggregate")
length(features)  # 66 + aggregated univariate

# Only multivariate sync and spectral features
features <- ts_features_all(X, feature_type = "multivariate",
                             multivariate_sets = c("sync", "spectral"))
}
