# CRAN Submission Comments

## Test environments

* macOS Sequoia 15.6.1, R 4.5.0 (local)
* GitHub Actions (ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macOS-latest), R-release

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There were 3 NOTEs:

1. **New submission**

   This is the first submission of tsdiscov to CRAN.

2. **Suggests or Enhances not in mainstream repositories: tsdl**

   The tsdl package is suggested for optional real-world time series examples
   in tests. It is used conditionally with `require("tsdl", quietly = TRUE)`
   and the package works fully without it. This package provides access to the
   Time Series Data Library for demonstration purposes only.

3. **HTML Tidy version**

   This is a local environment issue and does not affect the package
   functionality. CRAN's check servers have the appropriate tools.
