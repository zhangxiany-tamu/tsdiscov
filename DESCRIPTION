Description: Extracts 352 univariate, 6 bivariate, and 61 multivariate features from time series data.
    Includes statistical, spectral, entropy, complexity, and nonlinear measures with
    efficient C++ implementations. Bivariate features analyze pairwise relationships.
    Multivariate features cover PCA, correlation, synchronization, diversity, information theory,
    lag structure, and network topology. Supports automated feature selection via hypothesis
    testing with FDR/FWER correction.
